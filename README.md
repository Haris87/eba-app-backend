# EBA Toy App - Backend

a simple app to create, read, update and search entities

To start the app `git clone` it, create an `.env` file and add the connection url to a mongo db

```
CONNECTION_URL=mongodb+srv://<sername>:<password>@<domain>/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

after that run

```
npm install
npm start
```

I already have a backend hosted in heroku and a database on mongo cloud, you can check it out [here](http://eba-backend.herokuapp.com/)
